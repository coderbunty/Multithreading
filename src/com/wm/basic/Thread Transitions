Thread States
a) New state - Thread has been created, but it has not started yet.

b) Ready-to-run state - Thread's start() method is called, it is in this state when the thread starts its life.

c) Running state - Scheduler has chosen this thread to execute, it is having its CPU time.

d) Dead state - Thread reaches this state when the execution finishes or if it gets terminated abruptly.

e) Non-runnable states - Depending on certain circumstances, the thread can transition into this state. A thread remains
                         in this state until a special transition occurs. The thread doesn't directly go to the Running
                         state from a non-runnable state, but transits first to Ready-to-run state.
       Sleeping - thread sleeps for a specified amount of time.
       Blocked for I/o - thread waits for a blocking operation to complete
       Blocking for join completion - thread awaits completion of another thread
       Waiting for notification - thread awaits notification from another thread
       Blocked for lock acquisition - thread waits to acquire the lock of an object

Thread class provides the getState() to determine the state of the current thread. The method returns a constant of type Thread.State.
